# Introduction to gcc

`gcc` `GNU Compiler Collection`  is what I use on linux to compile `C` source files to binary. `gcc` is just the front-end for the collection of tools that process your binary. Meaning `gcc` will take your binary and pass it down along with some flags to a collection of `GNU` tools that process your binary in stages and finally output a binary executable.  `clang` is another front-end that will compile `C` source files using `llvm` in the back-end. [`clang`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) was made by google as a replacement for `gcc`, but It's not any better in my opinion.

This post will focus on `gcc` and break down the 4 stages gcc take to compile to an executable binary. 

```c
// main.c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	// typical hello world
	printf("hello world\n");
}
```

## The preprocessor
The first stage of the compilation process is the use of the preprocessor to expand macros and included header files. To perform this stage, `gcc` 
executes the following command: `cpp main.c > main.i`

`cpp` is the `c preprocessor`. By convention, preprocessed files are given the file extension '.i' for C programs and '.ii' for C++ programs.
```c
....
extern int ftrylockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)) ;
extern void funlockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
# 858 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
extern int __uflow (FILE *);
extern int __overflow (FILE *, int);
# 873 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
# 4 "main.c" 2
# 4 "main.c"
int main(){
    printf("hello world\n");
}
```
As you can see, the output is very big because we're including `<stdio.h>`.

##  The compiler
The next stage of the process is the actual compilation of preprocessed source code to assembly language, 
for a specific processor. The command-line option `-S` instructs `gcc` to convert the preprocessed C 
source code to assembly language.

`gcc -S main.i`

```c
; main.s
        .file   "main.c"
        .text
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "hello world"
        .text
        .globl  main
        .type   main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
        .cfi_startproc
        pushq   %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
        .cfi_offset 6, -16
        movq    %rsp, %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        call    puts
        movl    $0, %eax
        popq    %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
        ret
        .cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
        .size   main, .-main
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)"
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
```
The result of the previous command is this file `main.s`. This file contains the assembly language for your particular arch. 
**Note:** `gcc` uses `as` gnu assembler for assembling this file. however it's possible to use different assembler like nasm (the only real difference is the syntax).

## The assembler
The purpose of the assembler is to convert assembly language into machine code and generate an object file. 
When there are calls to external functions in the assembly source file, 
the assembler leaves the addresses of the external functions undefined, to be filled in later by the linker. 
The assembler can be invoked with the following command line: `as main.s -o main.o`

This will generate a binary object file. however in order to execute this file, 
you need to link the binary to the external functions from `libc` such as `printf` and many others. 
The resulting file `hello.o` contains the machine instructions for the _Hello World_ program, 
with an undefined reference to `printf`.


## The linker
The final stage of compilation is the linking of object files to create an executable. In practice, an executable requires many external functions from system and C run-time (`crt`) libraries. Consequently, the actual link commands used internally by GCC are complicated. For example, the full command for linking the _Hello World_ program is:

`$ ld -dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /usr/lib/crt1.o 
 /usr/lib/crti.o /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686/3.3.1/crtbegin.o 
 -L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686/3.3.1 hello.o -lgcc -lgcc_eh
 -lc -lgcc -lgcc_eh /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686/3.3.1/crtend.o 
 /usr/lib/crtn.o`

Fortunately there is never any need to type the command above directly--the entire linking process is handled transparently by `gcc` when invoked as follows:

`$ gcc main.o`

`$ ./a.out`

`$Hello, world`


This was the final stage to produce the binary file. As you have seen `gcc` is not that hard to understand 
once you know where to look for.

one last thing, you could instruct `gcc` to show you all output files of the 4 stages by passing it the 
flag `-save-temps`.  This will tell `gcc` to keep all intermediate files for you to see.
