title: Write assembly with gcc

## Introduction
This post will be in the form of a tutorial to help you get started writing assembly.
I will use the AT&T syntax for this tutorial because 
it's the default used by gcc and I just got used to it. 
To understand this tutorial fully, try the examples and do you're own research!

The best way to get started writing assembly is to write small simple programs 
in `C` and observing the output produced by `gcc`. 
Let's for example take a simple hello world example.

### Example

```c
// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("hello world\n");
}

// compile with gcc hello.c -o hello
// ./hello
hello world
```

Great, but when need to see the assembly code produced by `gcc`. 
To do that you need to pass the `-S` flag to `gcc` to tell it to go 
through the compilation process and stop at the assembly stage.
This will produce a file with the same name as your program name but ends with `.s` extensions.

```js
// hello.s
        .file   "hello.c"
        .text
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "hello world"
        .text
        .globl  main
        .type   main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
        .cfi_startproc
        pushq   %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
        .cfi_offset 6, -16
        movq    %rsp, %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        call    puts
        movl    $0, %eax
        popq    %rbp
        .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
        ret
        .cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
        .size   main, .-main
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)"
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits

```
However, the output is very long and hard to understand because of all the `.cfi...` 
directivies/macros used by `gcc`. 
It's added to help the assembler find resources and debug info (google it to better understand it).
So, it's not necessary and can be safely removed to help us understand the core of our program.

To get rid of the unnecessary gargon, pass the following flags to `gcc`.
`gcc -S hello.c -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-exceptions -Wall -Wextra`.

| use `-masm=intel` for intel output

```c
        .file   "hello.c"
        .text
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "hello world"
        .text
        .globl  main
        .type   main, @function
main:
        pushq   %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        call    puts
        movl    $0, %eax
        popq    %rbp
        ret
        .size   main, .-main
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1)"
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
```
Looks good already! Now let's go over the basics of this code.
- The first 2 lines are self explanatory but are not required. 
- The 3rd line defines the `rodata` section which is an area in the binary to store read only data such as predefined strings and numbers.

- `.LC0` is a label that holds the string `hello world\n` and falls under the `rodata` section.
- `.text` is a section in the binary where your actual code is stored.
- `.globl main` defines the main function globally to be called by `libc` later.
- `main:` is a lable that points to the first instruction in our code.

##### | Note: the code in the bottom after the `ret` instruction is not required and can be removed.

Now try to modify the string with the label `.LC0`, then compile and execute your program
with `gcc -c`.  `gcc` will take your assembly program assemble it and link it correctly.
`gcc -c hello.s -o hello && ./hello `

One thing to notice here is that the assembly generated by `gcc`  calls `puts` not `printf`.
And that's because `gcc` try to optimize for us when possible. 
But I want to to call `printf`; I don't want to use `puts`. 
Let's modify the assembly to make it use `printf` instead of `puts`.

```c
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "hello world"
        .text
        .globl  main
main:
        pushq   %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp

        subq    $16, %rsp
        movq    $.LC0, -8(%rbp)
        movq    -8(%rbp), %rdi
        movq    $0, %rax
        call    printf

        movl    $0, %eax
        leave
        ret
```
Now what we have done here is:
- allocated 16 bytes on the stack by moving `rsp` up.
- then we move the address of the string to `rbp-8` on the stack because `printf` reads from the stack.
- then we move the address of the string on the stack to `rdi` because it's the first arg to `printf`
- then we zero out `rax` for later use by `printf`
- then we call `printf`
- notice also that I changed `popq %rbp` to just `leave` 
because if you're doing more things in main you need to call `leave`.


Next, let's take this one step further and execute `write syscall` ourself instead of `printf`.

```c
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "hello world"
        .text
        .globl  main
main:
        pushq   %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp

        movq    $12, %rdx
        movq    $.LC0, %rsi
        movq    $1, %rdi
        movq    $1, %rax
        syscall

        movl    $0, %eax
        leave
        ret
```
very easy right! If you need help looking up the syscall signature use [Filippo.io](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/)

The basics:
- move the length of the string size into `rdx`
- move address of string to `rsi`
- move file descripter to `rdi`
- move `syscall` number to `rax`
- call `syscall` (equivalent to `int 0x80` in x86-32 which calls interrupt)


### Last example for you to understand
This program reads from `stdin` a string and `printf` the string to `stdout`.

```c
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "buffer is : %s"
        .text
        .globl  main
main:
.LFB0:
        pushq   %rbp
        movq    %rsp, %rbp
        subq    $32, %rsp
        leaq    -32(%rbp), %rsi # move address of buffer to rsi
        movl    $20, %edx       # size of buffer
        movl    $1, %edi        # stdin file discripter
        movl    $0, %eax        # syscall read
        syscall

        leaq    -32(%rbp), %rax
        movq    %rax, %rsi
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        movl    $0, %eax
        call    printf

        movl    $0, %eax
        leave
        ret
```
