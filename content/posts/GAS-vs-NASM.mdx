### What is an assembler?

Before an assembly program can be executed on a computer, it must be translated into the computer's binary machine code.
The translation state is done by a program called `assembler`.
The assembler takes your code and assembly it to an object file and the object file is linked with other object files to form an executable.

There are many object file formats. Some you should know about include:
- OMF: used in DOS but has 32-bit extensions for Windows. Old.
- COFF: "Common object file format"
- ELF, ELF32: Used in modern 32-bit Linux and elsewhere
- ELF64: Used in 64-bit Linux and elsewhere
- Win, Win32: Microsoftâ€™s version of COFF, not exactly the same! Replaces OMF
. . . .

> To make the object file executable, you need a linker that understands
> the object file formats you produce and can write executable for the os.

> Unix systems use the ld linker. `ld` is part of the gnu assembler collections.
> Microsoft use LINK.EXE for linking.

[`GAS`](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/) stands for the GNU Assembler. It's part of the back end of the Gnu compiler collections. The gnu assembler uses the ugly AT&T-style syntax; however you can configure it to use the intel-style syntax.

[`NASM`](https://www.nasm.us/docs.php) stands for The Netwide Assembler. It's free, small, and supports many different types of object files and architectures.

### Simple hello world in x86-64
##### GAS
```js
# bin.s

  .global _start 
  .text
start:  
	# write(1, message, 13)
 mov $1,  %rax  	# system call 1 is write 
 mov $1,  %rdi  	# file handle 1 is stdout
 mov $message, %rsi  	# address of string to output 
 mov $13,  %rdx 	# number of bytes 
 syscall 		# invoke operating system to do the write
  # exit(0)
 mov $60,  %rax  	# system call 60 is exit 
 xor %rdi,  %rdi  	# we want return code 0 
 syscall 		# invoke operating system to exit
message:  
.ascii  "Hello, world\n"
```
few things to notice here, One, the syntax is a little ugly. Second, comments are prefixed with `#` char.  Third, the use of the `syscall` instruction. the `syscall` instruction invokes an interrupt to jump into the os memory to do some low level work. `syscall`works only in 64 bit mod.

AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and destination operands. For example:
```
- Intel: mov eax, 4
- AT&T: mov $4, %eax
```
To make This example look a little better we could use the Intel syntax instead of the AT&T.  To use they Intel syntax, you need to add the directive `.intel_syntax noprefix`.

```js
.intel_syntax noprefix
.global _start
        .text
_start:
        # write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1                 # system call 1 is write
        mov     rdi, 1                 # file handle 1 is stdout
        mov     rsi, offset message    # address of string to output
        mov     rdx, 13                # number of bytes
        syscall                        # invoke operating system to do the write

        # exit(0)
        mov     rax, 60                # system call 60 is exit
        xor     rdi, rdi               # we want return code 0
        syscall                        # invoke operating system to exit
message:
        .ascii  "Hello, world\n"
```
Now assemble, link, and run with `as bin.s -o bin.o &&  ld bin.o && ./a.out`.

##### NASM
```js
; bin.asm
          global    _start
          section   .text
_start:   mov       rax, 1                  ; system call for write
          mov       rdi, 1                  ; file handle 1 is stdout
          mov       rsi, message            ; address of string
          mov       rdx, 13                 ; number of bytes
          syscall                           ; invoke operating system to do the write
          mov       rax, 60                 ; system call for exit
          xor       rdi, rdi                ; exit code 0
          syscall                           ; invoke operating system to exit

          section   .data
message:  
db        "Hello, World", 10      ; note the newline at the end
```
notice here that we use `;` for comments and `db` to define an `ascii` string. The syntax is almost identical except for few minor things. To assemble, link and run this, do `nasm -felf64 bin.asm && ld bin.o && ./a.out`

As a last exercise, we could take a look at the same code in 32 bit mod.
#### GAS x86-32
```js
# bin.s
.intel_syntax noprefix                                                                                                                                            .global _start  
        .text
_start:
        # write(1, message, 13)
        mov     eax, 4                 # system call 4 is write
        mov     ebx, 1                 # stdout file handler
        mov     ecx, offset message    # address of string
        mov     edx, 13                # number of bytes
        int     0x80                   # invoke interrupt

        # exit(0)
        mov     eax, 1                # system call 60 is exit
        int     0x80                  # invoke interrupt
message:
        .ascii  "Hello, world\n"
```
notice 2 things here, One  we use the 32 bit version of the registers and two the number of `write syscall` changes to `4`.

 In 32 bit mode we use the 32 bit version of registers, so for example instead of using `eax` we use `rax`, also the use of different registers for holding data and the use of `int` instruction instead of `syscall` instruction.  
 To run this code, do `as --32 bin.s -o bin.o && ld -m elf_i386 -s bin.o` then run `./a.out`.

#### NASM x86-32
```js
; bin.asm
          global    _start
          section   .text
_start:   mov       eax, 4                 ; system call for write
          mov       ebx, 1                 ; stdout file handler
          mov       ecx, message           ; address of string
          mov       edx, 13                ; number of bytes
          int       0x80		   ; invoke interrupt

          mov       eax, 1                 ; system call for exit
          int       0x80                   ; invoke interrupt

          section   .data
message:  db        "Hello, World", 10 
```
Same things here! 

To run this code, do `nasm -f elf bin.asm && ld -m elf_i386 -s bin.o` then run `./a.out`.
