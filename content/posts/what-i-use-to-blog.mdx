title: What I use to blog

I looked for many platforms to make this easy for me; 
I looked at wordpress but it was on overkill and very slow for my simple use case.
I could've probably done some configuration to make it faster but I didn't want to deal with it.
I wanted something simple, fast and cheep.
I also looked at [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) but writing html and css by hand was very
tedious. so I sesettled on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (static site generater).


Gatsby make things much easier And have many plugins to help you get going fast.
You could use gatsby on the server or the client. Gatsby is basically Reactjs with a bit more.


For this blog I use `gatsby-theme-blog`.
it's very easy to setup!

- First install nodejs, npm, and the `gatsby-cli`
- Start a new project `gatsby new <project-name> <url-for-starter-repo>`
- Create blog posts

### To install Gatsby-cli
```js
npm install -g gatsby-cli
// or install locally and use npx to use
npm install gatsby-cli
// and when using gatsby, you use npx
npx gatsby
```


### Create blog template

```jsx
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
// or if you installed gatsby locally, use
npx gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

### To run the dev server
```js
cd my-blog && gatsby develop
// or
cd my-blog && sudo npx gatsby develop
```

And finally I use github and netlify to host my blog.
