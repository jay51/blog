Hi everyone!

I'm Jamal and this is my first blog post.
This blog will be about all the things that interest me or everything I learn about.
I typically like to talk about low-level stuff such as operating systems, embeded devices, and hacking.
I upload almost all of my projects to my ([Github](https://github.com/jay51)).

My schedule is very tight, so I can't post every week but I will try to post at least once every month.  

This is going to be fun!

I love blogging so much already.
