### Web Authentication
Befor we explore the many ways of authenticating on the web, I need to tell that the web was not desinged with authentication in mind. 
It was desinged to share files between few people in deferent parts of the world. so a lot of the decisions that were made at the time to make this work
had to layer upon the work of other developers which made it hard to work properly. However authentication is hard generally, so there's no one solution fit all.

#### Authentication Types We will cover:
    - Basic Authentication
    - Cookies Authentication
    - Session Authentication
    - JWT Authentication


# Basic Auth

Basic authentication is a simple authentication mechanism built into the HTTP protocol. The way it works is, The client send an HTTP request to the server
requesting a webpage and the server respond back saying "This webpage is protected and you need to authenticate to view it". The way the sever does that
is by sending HTTP response back with the Header `WWW-Authenticate: Basic`. When the `Browser` or client receive this header, it shows you a popup box
to input your username and password (In the case of a different client other than the Browser, you need to check for that header yourself). Then the 
Browser base64 encode the username and password and sends it back to the server in `Authorization` Header `Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==`.

# Cookie Auth
In the case of Cookie Authentication, it's very similer to Basic Auth. A client trys to access a webpage, server says "you need to authenticat" and sends
back a `HTML` form for the user to input the data and send it back to server. We then take the data verify the user and store the data in a cookie sent
in the header for subsequent request because `HTTP` protocol is stateless; meaning we don't remember users. So every connectin is a new connection. 

However this model of authentication is not secure because someone could see the data inside the cookie and steal the data. So what we could do is
encrypt the cookie with a secret only know by the server and send back the encrypted data. When the Browser make a request we check for the cookie.  If 
we have a cookie, we decrypt the cookie to extract the `username` and `password`. if we don't have a cookie, it means that this user is not authenticated.

** This may sound secure now but it's really not because if an attacker was able to capture your cookie, they can the try to decrypt it and steal your
credentials. **


# Session Auth
Session authentication is exactly the same as cookie authentication but instead of storeing the data inside the cooke and sending it back and forth,
we instead store the data in a session storege on the server (session storeage could be a file system or a database). 
And send back a cookie with the hash of the data. Then when the Browser try to access our webpage we check for the hash inside the cookie; if the hash
is inside our session storeage, it means this person is authenticated otherwise he's not. To deauthenticate someone, we just need to remove that person
hash from our session storage.



# JWT Auth
JWT authentication is very simple and mainly used for making APIs or if your server (back-end) and client (front-end) are separate entities. 
Similar to `Session Auth`, JWT uses a hash or something that uniquely identifies each user in the database to authenticate users.
When the user send his information to authenticate, the server will send back a unique ID that identifies each user in the database alongside other info
if necessary in the [`JWT`](https://jwt.io/) format. Then at that point it's the responsibility of the client (front-end) to store the `JWT` in `local storage` or elsewher
and send it back to the server on each subsequent request. When the sever gets the `JWT`, it base64 decode it and lookup that user in the database by
his unique identifier that we stored in the `JWT` and send back the necessary information.

** It's important to say that `JWT` format is not encrypted so don't store cretical data in the `JWT`**
